    "This cell applies a systematic method to clean missing values from the ZTF dataset. Real astronomical datasets often contain gaps—some observations may be incomplete, corrupted, or missing certain metadata fields. Instead of removing all rows with missing values (which would waste valuable data), this cell uses a balanced strategy to preserve as much information as possible while still ensuring dataset quality.\n",

    "The process begins by removing only those rows that are mostly empty (more than 50% missing values). This avoids keeping rows that contain almost no useful information. After that, the cell separates numerical and categorical columns because each type requires a different method for filling missing values. Numerical columns—such as flux values, coordinates, or exposure metadata—are filled using the **median**, which is a stable and reliable measure that reduces the influence of outliers. Categorical columns—such as file names, filter types, or detector IDs—are filled using the **mode**, which replaces missing values with the most common category.\n",

    "Astronomical measurements often contain noise, extreme values, and hidden patterns that are difficult to detect without transforming the raw data. By generating features such as SNR, time components, and logarithmic versions of skewed measurements, the dataset becomes far richer and more expressive. These engineered features help machine-learning models better interpret celestial behavior, improve prediction accuracy, and capture scientific relationships that are essential in astroinformatics. This step significantly enhances the dataset’s value and paves the way for more powerful and reliable modelling.\n",

    "This cell checks whether the dataset contains a target or label column (such as “class”, “type”, or “target”) and, if so, it attempts to correct **class imbalance** using SMOTE. Class imbalance happens when one category has many more samples than others. This is very common in astronomy—for example, there may be thousands of normal observations but only a few rare events like supernovae or unusual transients. If this imbalance is not handled, machine-learning models tend to ignore the rare classes and perform poorly on the very objects scientists care most about.\n",

SMOTE creates new synthetic examples for the minority classes by interpolating between existing observations. This helps balance the dataset without simply duplicating rows. The cell uses only numerical features for SMOTE, generates a new balanced dataset, and prints the final shape. If SMOTE cannot run (e.g., missing library or no numerical columns), the cell safely skips resampling and prints a clear message.\n",
