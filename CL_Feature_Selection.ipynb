    "\n",
    "- ✔ Ensures the dataset for modeling is **clean, compact, and optimized**  \n",
    "- ✔ Removes unnecessary features, improving model accuracy and training speed  \n",
    "- ✔ Preserves astronomy-required attributes, protecting scientific meaning  \n",
    "- ✔ Produces reusable files to keep the research workflow organized  \n",
    "- ✔ Makes it easy to share or re-run experiments consistently  \n",

    "> “The final selected features were exported into a compact dataset (`ztf_selected_features.csv`) and accompanied by a feature list file. All irrelevant identifiers were removed, and the target variable was preserved when present. This ensured a clean, model-ready dataset aligned with both machine-learning principles and astrophysical interpretability.”\n",
